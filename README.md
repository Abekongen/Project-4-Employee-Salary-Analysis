## Methodology

### Ask
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand salary distributions across departments, identify gender pay gaps, and examine the effect of education and experience on salaries.

### Prepare
Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and categorizing salary bins (Low, Medium, High) based on salary ranges. Departments were encoded for easy visualization.

### Process
The data was processed using statistical techniques to compute averages, sums, and counts. Visualizations were created to illustrate findings, including bar charts for average salaries and scatter plots for experience versus salary.

### Analyze
The analysis involved examining:
- Total salaries by department and salary bins.
- Average salaries segmented by gender within each department.
- Salary averages based on education levels.
- Relationship between experience and salary.

### Act
Based on the findings, recommendations were formulated for addressing identified pay disparities, improving recruitment strategies, and enhancing employee retention based on salary competitiveness.
